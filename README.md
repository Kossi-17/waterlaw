this is my first 'end to end' data analysis project
it is an analysis of the global education data
in this first project, i learn how to structure my code, how to actually think about what I want the end result should be before even starting to code.
I made a lot of mistake, I reaseached a lot, look a lot of people code.  I think that helped me understand peope code and to see their flow of coding
It was a really mindblowing experience to be honest.
I am excited to take on more and more projects to hone my analysis skills
